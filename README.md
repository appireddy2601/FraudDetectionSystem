## Introduction
Fraud detection is crucial in many industries, particularly in finance, to prevent significant losses. This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction records, with features representing various attributes of the transactions. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
